                        </h3>
                        <p>Solo Stove went public as part of Solo Brands, a premium DTC ecommerce platform for outdoor retailers. Improving the sitewide customer experience and increasing the bottom-line were top priorities. We redesigned core parts of our customer experience in a multi-tiered approach that resulted in the overhaul of our product detail pages, cart slider, and cart page. </p>

                    <p>A cart slider was implemented in place of an existing modal to accomodate the addition of product bundling on our product detail page, a gift with purchase program, and product recommendations. Key order details and a path to the cart page and checkout were added as a sticky component at the bottom to ensure they were always insight for customers to progress in the journey.</p>

                        <h4>Developing the Design System</h4>
                        <p>Design systems were new to Solo Stove when I started this project. Another designer had recently begun to establish a style guide and some core individual components such as buttons, inputs, and cards. However, content structures, page layouts and templates were not created. Redesigning core parts of the experience supported the development of the design system by allowing us to reuse components.</p>

                        <h4>Improving Efficiency of QA Process</h4>
                        <p>Doing remote design quality assurance proved to be time consuming and at times inefficient. I provided annotated screenshots and video recordings for an external development agency and in-house engineer. My one-on-one call with an in-house engineer proved to be most fruitful, where we were able to align on outstanding issues and our expectations of when they should be fixed. It became clear that a rating system that includes the severity of the issue and a timeframe to fix them could be valuable to incorporate into our process.</p>
