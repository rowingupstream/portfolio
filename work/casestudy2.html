                        <h3>Solo Stove is a rapidly growing DTC lifestyle brand that develops innovative outdoor products. Their best-selling products include fire pits, pizza ovens, and camp stoves.
                        </h3>
                        <p>The launch of Solo Stove's iconic, stainless steel fire pits made it a household name in outdoor living. The company experienced a compounded annual growth rate of 132% from 2016 through the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2021. While the business was soaring to new heights, Solo Stove's online presence hampered the overall customer experience and needed to be addressed before the company could continue its expansion. For these reasons, we rebuilt the navigation on the legacy site, designed multiple variations for testing, and then launched a new and improved navigation once we migrated to a headless CMS.</p>

                        <h4>Developing the Design System</h4>
                        <p>Design systems were new to Solo Stove when I started this project. Another designer had recently begun to establish a style guide and some core individual components such as buttons, inputs, and cards. However, content structures, page layouts or templates were not created. Designing these new product detail pages enabled me to expand our design system by creating new layouts that could be reused as templates elsewhere in the customer experience.</p>

                        <h4>Improving Efficiency of QA Process</h4>
                        <p>Doing remote design quality assurance proved to be time consuming and at times inefficient. I provided annotated screenshots and video recordings for an external development agency and in-house engineer. My one-on-one call with an in-house engineer proved to be most fruitful, where we were able to align on outstanding issues and our expectations of when they should be fixed. It became clear that a rating system that includes the severity of the issue and a timeframe to fix them could be valuable to incorporate into our process.</p>
