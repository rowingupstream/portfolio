                        <h3>Solo Stove is a rapidly growing DTC lifestyle brand that develops innovative outdoor products. Their best-selling products include fire pits, pizza ovens, and camp stoves.
                        </h3>
                        <p>Solo Stove was entering a new product category with the launch of its outdoor pizza oven, bundles and related accessories. I redesigned product detail pages for the entire collection, which would serve as the template for all Solo Stove products. The Pi Pizza Oven launch proved to be the perfect opportunity to create a better experience for customers by utilizing data and insights from the previous page and through competitive research and analysis. </p>

                        <p>Engaging internal Marketing, Product, and Executive leadership made it clear that there was work to be done to gather each teamâ€™s perspective and get alignment on how the navigation could best reflect user needs and the future of the company.  Knowing what I do now, I would have started this process earlier. It took considerable time and effort to gain alignment across internal leadership, while pushing up against a hard deadline.</p>

                        <h4>Improving Efficiency of QA Process</h4>
                        <p>Doing design quality insurance remotely with an external development agency and eventually an in-house engineer proved to be time consuming. I provided annotated screenshots and video recordings to highlight issues that I recommended addressing. My one-on-one call with an in-house engineer proved to be most fruitful, where we were able to align on outstanding issues and our expectations of when they should be fixed. In differentiating between fixes that needed to be done before launch and those that would occur after it also became clear that a rating system for the severity of the issue and the timing it could be fixed could be valuable to incorporate into our process.</p>
