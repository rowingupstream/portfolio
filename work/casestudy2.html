Content structures, page layouts, and templates were then created to allow for greater efficiency in product development through reusable components.

                        <p>Initially, QA proved to be time consuming and inefficient as there were few tools or clear processes involved. I optimized this through the implementation of: annotated screenshots and video recordings for internal and external partners, one-on-one calls with in-house engineers to align on outstanding issues and prioritization, development of a rating system to note severity of issues and a timeframe to fix them.</p>
