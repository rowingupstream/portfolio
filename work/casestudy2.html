                        <h3>Solo Stove is a rapidly growing DTC lifestyle brand that develops innovative outdoor products. Their best-selling products include fire pits, pizza ovens, and camp stoves.
                        </h3>
                        <p>Solo Stove entered a new product category with the launch of an outdoor pizza oven and related bundles and accessories. I redesigned product detail pages for the entire product collection, which then served as the template for all Solo Stove products. The Pi Pizza Oven launch proved to be the perfect opportunity to create a better experience for customers by utilizing data and insights from the old page design and through competitive research and analysis.</p>

                        <h4>Developing the Design System</h4>
                        <p>Design systems were new to Solo Stove when I started this project. Another designer had recently begun to establish a style guide and some core individual components such as buttons, inputs, and cards. However, content structures, page layouts and templates were not created. Designing these new product detail pages enabled me to create layouts that were established as templates in our design system, so they could be reused in key parts of the customer journey.</p>

                        <h4>Improving Efficiency of QA Process</h4>
                        <p>Providing annotated screenshots and video recordings for an external development agency and eventually an in-house engineer when the project came back in-house was time consuming. My call with an in-house engineer was most effective because we reviewed the issues together and aligned on the fixes and timing. It became clear that we could benefit from a system to rate the severity of an issue, which would determine if and when fixes would occur.</p>
