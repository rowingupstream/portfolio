The goal of the simulator is to assist these organizations in preparing and responding to COVID-19 and future epidemics. 7 million people are in refugee-like situations living in camps. Refugee camps around the world lack the information necessary to support response planning and advocacy efforts to acquire life-saving medical resources. Health agencies and universities are focused on modeling the impact of COVID-19 on a global and national level.</p>

                    <h3>User Surveys</h3>
                    <p>Our user survey provided us key information such as the focus of each NGOs work, the type of settlements NGO professionals work in, the current situation related to COVID-19, and the public health interventions that have been implemented or are being planned. The survey was valuable in creating a research cohort of engaged NGO professionals willing to participate in user interviews.</p>
                    <p>Our survey questions aimed at acquiring qualitative and quantitative data that would provide the team with better context of the environments that NGO professionals are working in related to COVID-19 and living conditions and interactions that could affect the spread and inform our modeling team. While the questions were aimed at acquiring valuable information I was concerned that the survey was too long and would result in a poor response rate. </p>
                    <p>We agreed to start with the existing version and if we didn't get a sufficient number of responses then we could pare it down. The first survey went out to 350 individuals, but only yielded 7 responses. Based on that, we reduced the number of questions from 28 to 16 questions. The shorter version of the survey yielded an additional 15 responses, more than double the amount of the lengthier survey.</p>

                    <h3>User Interviews</h3>
                    <p>We conducted interviews with respondents to our surveys and by tapping into our team's professionals in the global NGO community. We conducted 9 interviews with people, who provided services both directly and indirectly to refugees in Afghanistan, Greece, Hong Kong, Iraq, Lebanon, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Turkey.</p>
                    <p>I worked with the NGO professionals and Data Scientists on our team to create an outline for the interviews. Our goal was to prioritize questions that would provide context about the COVID-19 situation in refugee camps, to gain insights that may support the Modeling Team’s work and to learn if any tools were being used to prepare or respond to COVID-19.</p>
                    <p>Below is a list of topics that we covered throughout the interviews.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>COVID-19 Situation</li>

                        <h4>Context Is Everything</h4>
                        <p>It was clear that NGO workers work in a variety of different environments, each with it’s own set of challenges and constraints. This was revealed in our user surveys and reinforced as we conducted user interviews with NGO workers stationed around the world. The people we spoke with worked in environments ranging from Hong Kong, rural Africa, Iraq, and Afghanistan.</p>

                    <div class="learnings">
                        <h4>Working With Sensitive Data</h4>
                        <p>Throughout the project, one of our priorities was respecting the privacy of the individuals and organizations willing to participate in our user research. This became even more critical as we worked with NGO professionals in unsafe situations where human rights violations occur regularly and law enforcement needs to occur.</p>

                    <div class="learnings">
                        <h4>Coordinating a Global Team</h4>
                        <p>Working with a remote global team across multiple time zones and continents early in the pandemic required effective coordination and communication to manage the project and maintain momentum. This became even more challenging as our research participants were on different time zones and had limited time due to their responsibilities in the field.
