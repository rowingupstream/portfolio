                        <p>Modeling the spread of COVID-19 within refugee settlements and creating an interactive web tool for NGO professionals to predict the possible spread of COVID-19 to support them in the areas below. The goal of the simulator is to assist these organizations in preparing and responding to COVID-19 and future epidemics. 7 million people are in refugee-like situations living in camps. Refugee camps around the world lack the information necessary to support response planning and advocacy efforts to acquire life-saving medical resources. Health agencies and universities are focused on modeling the impact of COVID-19 on a global and national level.</p>
