                        <h3>Solo Stove is a rapidly growing DTC lifestyle brand that develops innovative outdoor products. Their best-selling products include fire pits, pizza ovens, and camp stoves.
                        </h3>
                        <p>The launch of Solo Stove's iconic, stainless steel fire pits made it a household name in outdoor living. The company experienced a compounded annual growth rate of 132% from 2016 through the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2021. Despite this success, there was a clear need to invest to in its e-commerce infrastructure and design to reflect the current state of the business, launch new product offerings and markets, and to meet customer's needs. For these reasons, we rebuilt the navigation on the legacy site, designed multiple variations for testing, and then launched a new and improved navigation once we migrated to a headless CMS.

                <div class="results-three-col">
                    <div class="learnings">
                        <h4>Phased Approach</h4>
                        <p>Our team agreed that the navigation had room for improvement, but having just kicked off a full rebuild of our entire e-commerce site meant that there were few resources that we could dedicate to this initially. We broke up the navigation updates into phases, which enabled us to see results immediately after the initial phase, where we eliminated accessibility issues, improved category and product hierarchy and addressed usability issues that we identified in an audit.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="learnings">
                        <h4>Reprioritizing Categories & Products</h4>
                        <p>An audit of the old navigation revealed that the hierarchy of some categories, sub-categories, and products did not align with the priority of the business and the percentage of revenue that it represented. Utilizing available product revenue data I made recommendations to leadership that would better serve our customers and the business, which were approved and implemented.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="learnings">
                        <h4>Addressing Planning Needs</h4>
                        <p>Having been a part of multiple product launches at the company I learned that there was a gap in navigation planning for new product categories and products. By identifying this I was able to work more closely with our Product Marketing and our E-Commerce team to ensure that new products were featured in the most effective way possible and I also identified upcoming design and development needs based on our go-to-market strategy.</p>
