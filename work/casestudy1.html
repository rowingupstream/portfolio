                        <h3>Solo Stove is a rapidly growing DTC lifestyle brand that develops innovative outdoor products. Their best-selling products include fire pits, pizza ovens, and camp stoves.
                        </h3>
                        <p>The launch of Solo Stove's iconic, stainless steel fire pits made it a household name in outdoor living. The company experienced a compounded annual growth rate of 132% from 2016 through the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2021. Despite this success, there was a clear need to invest to in its e-commerce infrastructure and design to reflect the current state of the business, launch new product offerings and markets, and to meet customer's needs. For these reasons, we rebuilt the navigation on the legacy site, designed multiple variations for testing, and then launched a new and improved navigation once we migrated to a headless CMS.

                        <h4>Align Align Align</h4>
                        <p>Engaging internal Marketing, Product, and Executive leadership made it clear that there was work to be done to gather each teamâ€™s perspective and get alignment on how the navigation could best reflect user needs and the future of the company.  Knowing what I do now, I would have started this process earlier. It took considerable time and effort to gain alignment across internal leadership, while pushing up against a hard deadline.</p>

                        <h4>Plan For Future Needs</h4>
                        <p>Stakeholder interviews revealed new product categories, new audiences, and differing points of view that needed to be included. It was clear that the navigation did not accurately represent the new positioning of the company. These conversations provided a clearer picture of the company roadmap. We were able to design and build with this in mind, which allowed us to make more informed decisions and create a better navigation menu.</p>

                        <h4>Pushing Forward</h4>
                        <p>We were under a tight deadline and the company rebrand was behind schedule just days before a high-profile launch. This created challenges and required us to manage expectations internally. Due to deadline constraints, the agency responsible for the build was unable to launch the navigation as designed. Post launch we worked to get closer to the original design. Then we shifted work back in-house where we continued to make improvements.</p>
