                        <h3>Improving the existing navigation of a premium outdoors retailer and redesigning a new, elevated navigation in preparation for a headless platform migration.
                        </h3>
                        <p>After performing a heuristic evaluation on Solo Stoveâ€™s existing navigation and reviewing site analytics and sales data it became clear that there was room to improve the existing navigation before we would be able to build a new one. I worked with our Testing and Personalization Manager and our engineering team to fix existing usability issues, improve the information hierarchy, and reprioritize categories and products based on data. I then redesigned the navigation in preparation for a future migration of our site to a headless ecommerce platform.

                    <div class="learnings">
                        <h4>Phased Approach</h4>
                        <p>Our team agreed that the navigation had room for improvement, but having just kicked off a full rebuild of our entire e-commerce site meant that there were few resources that we could dedicate to this initially. We broke up the navigation updates into phases, which enabled us to see results immediately after the initial phase, where we eliminated accessibility issues, improved category and product hierarchy and addressed usability issues that we identified in an audit.</p>

                    <div class="learnings">
                        <h4>Reprioritizing Categories & Products</h4>
                        <p>An audit of the old navigation revealed that the hierarchy of some categories, sub-categories, and products did not align with the priority of the business and the percentage of revenue that it represented. Utilizing available product revenue data I made recommendations to leadership that would better serve our customers and the business, which were approved and implemented.</p>

                    <div class="learnings">
                        <h4>Addressing Planning Needs</h4>
                        <p>Having been a part of multiple product launches, I identified that there was a gap in navigation planning for new product categories and products. By identifying this I was able to work more closely with our Product Marketing and our E-Commerce team to ensure that new products were featured in the most effective way possible and I also identified upcoming design and development needs based on our go-to-market strategy.</p>
