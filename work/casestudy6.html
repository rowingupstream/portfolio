                        <h4>Content That Converts</h4>
                        <p>Design systems were new to Solo Stove when I started this project. Another designer had recently begun to establish a style guide and some core individual components such as buttons, inputs, and cards. However, content structures, page layouts or templates were not created. Designing these new product detail pages enabled me to expand our design system by creating new layouts that could be reused as templates elsewhere in the customer experience.</p>

                        <h4>Future Improvements</h4>
                        <p>Doing remote design quality assurance proved to be time consuming and at times inefficient. I provided annotated screenshots and video recordings for an external development agency and in-house engineer. My one-on-one call with an in-house engineer proved to be most fruitful, where we were able to align on outstanding issues and our expectations of when they should be fixed. It became clear that a rating system that includes the severity of the issue and a timeframe to fix them could be valuable to incorporate into our process.</p>
