                        <h3>Fresh Market is a regional grocer focused on increasing same store sales by allowing customers to order meals and deli offerings during lunch through their website.
                        </h3>
                        <p>Enabling customers to order meals for the first-time was a big change for Fresh Market. I created an online ordering website where customers could order their favorite lunch options for either pickup or delivery. My design process included four phases: research, analysis, ideation, and prototyping. I relied on process to guide the project and to ensure that I was creating a user-focused experience.

                        <h4>New Challenges</h4>
                        <p>Creating this web prototype was both a challenging and rewarding experience. Most of the processes, concepts, and prototyping were new to me. New questions and insights developed at each stage of the project due to research and testing. This made me question what I thought I knew and it encouraged me to reevaluate the next steps and actions I planned to take.</p>

                    <div class="learnings">
                        <h4>Filling Research Gaps</h4>
                        <p>The user research methods that I employed filled gaps and created a more complete picture of the user. Witnessing user behavior during competitor and prototype testing was thought-provoking and provided valuable insights that I utilized in future iterations of the product. It reinforced the importance of user research, user testing, and overcoming assumptions.</p>

                        <h4>Design Iteration</h4>
                        <p>At each phase of the project there were new insights and challenges that required changes to the product. Each iteration of the product was an improvement on the previous version, which better served the userâ€™s needs. This experience cemented the idea that design is a continuous process of discovery and refinement and that there is no perfect product.</p>
