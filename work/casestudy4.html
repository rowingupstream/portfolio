                        <p>I collaborated with the Demand Generation team to design a new demo page in an effort to create a more compelling and streamlined experience for B2B prospects. To create more interest and engagement we added partner testimonial videos, prominent partner logos for social proof, and leadership videos. I also created multiple designs to test an an effort to determine ways we might be able to increase conversion. During this process, I uncovered a major pain point for the Demand Generation and Customer support teams that I worked to resolve.</p>

                    <h3>Getting to the Core Issues</h3>
                    <p>Since DailyPay provides employees with early access to their earned wages, any issue with a transaction can impact their ability to pay unexpected bills or respond to family needs and emergencies. Therefore, customer support issues are high priority for them to resolve. To gain insights into these issues I evaluated the site for additional customer support channels and spoke with a Customer Support Lead. Below are the main reasons that I believe were causing employees to use the demo page for customer support issues.</p>
                    <!-- <ul>
                        <li>No Feedback on Customer Support Form - Upon form submission there was no indiation of standard or current response times from customer support.</li>
                        <li>Customer Support Ticket Backlog - Due to rapid growth product growth the customer support team was ramping up hiring. As a result the customer support backlog and response times also increased.</li>
                        <li>No Representation in the Navigation - There was an employee landing page, but the website was primarily focused on B2B prospects. There was no top-level navigation item directing employees to learn more or toward desired support channels.</li>
                        <li>Low-Effort Fixes on Demo Page - I learned that the addition of radio buttons to the demo page was a quick fix by the Demand Generation team to prevent customer support requests from getting mixed up with B2B demo requests. Otherwise, team members wasted time contacting employees and had to manually refer them to customer support. I believed that this quick fix was actually encouraging customer behavior that we wanted to put an end to.</li>

                    <h3 class="block-header">Short-Term Solutions</h3>
                    <p>To prevent customer support requests from getting co-mingled with B2B demo requests, radio buttons had been added, which encouraged more requests.</p>

                        <h4>What We Changed</h4>
                        <p>Evaluating the site and speaking with internal stakeholders enabled us to improve the demo page and better serve both our B2B and B2C customers. We streamlined the demo form by removing the radio buttons, added a Login link for employees below the demo request form, so they could submit customer support issue through an appropriate channel if they landed on that page, and added “Employees” and related sub-categories to the top-level navigation, so both existing and prospective employees could more easily find answers to their questions and customer support channels.</p>

                    <div class="learnings">
                        <h4>Pushing Forward</h4>
                        <p>We were under a tight deadline and the company rebrand was behind schedule just days before a high-profile launch. This created challenges and required us to manage expectations internally. Due to deadline constraints, the agency responsible for the build was unable to launch the navigation as designed. Post launch we worked to get closer to the original design. Then we shifted work back in-house where we continued to make improvements.</p>
