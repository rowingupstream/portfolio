                        <p>I collaborated with the Demand Generation team to design a new demo page in an effort to create a more compelling and streamlined experience for B2B prospects. To create more interest and engagement we added partner testimonial videos, prominent partner logos for social proof, and leadership videos. I also created multiple designs to test an an effort to determine ways we might be able to increase conversion. During this process, I uncovered a major pain point for the Demand Generation and Customer support teams that I worked to resolve.</p>

                    <h3>Finding the Root Causes of the Problem</h3>
                    <p>When I evaluated the old demo page I wondered why there was a radio button group with an option to request a demo and an option for customer support requests. DailyPay’s model is to B2B and B2C because they sign up a company, who then offers the product as a benefit to their employees. However, the demo was clearly not intended to be a customer support channel. My intuition was that the radio buttons could drive down conversion and was an unnecessary choice for B2B prospects.</p>
                    <p>First, it should be noted that DailyPay provides employees early access to earned wages. Therefore, any problem with a transaction is of the utmost importance and can impact an employee’s ability to pay for unexpected bills, family needs, or emergencies. After evaluating the website for additional customer support channels and speaking with a Customer Support Lead I began to form a clearer picture of why customers may be using the demo page for customer support inquiries.</p>
                    <p>Below are the key reasons that I discovered were causing the issues.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Customer Support Contact Form - There was no feedback of standard response times or expectation of when a customer would hear from a customer support support team member.</li>
                        <li>Customer Support Ticket Backlog - Due to rapid growth of the product the customer support team was ramping up hiring. However, as a result the customer support ticket backlog was increasing and response times were also delayed.</li>
                        <li>Employees Not Represented in Main Navigation - Although there was an employee landing page the website as a whole was focused on B2B prospects and there was no section to direct employees in the navigation. While one of the desired support channels was in the app, some employees were still turning to the website for help and answers to their questions.</li>
                        <li>Quick Fixes on Demo Page - The addition of the radio buttons to the demo page was a quick fix by the Demand Generation team, to avoid customer support requests from getting mixed up with their B2B prospects. They wanted to avoid unknowingly contacting them to schedule a demo or having to manual refer them to customer support. However, without solving the problems listed above I believed that this action was actually encouraging customer behavior that we wanted to put an end to.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In the end, my time spent evaluating the existing site and talking to internal stakeholders enabled us to improve the demo page and better serve both our B2B and B2C customers. We streamlined the demo form by removing the radio buttons, added a Login link for employees below the demo request form so that they could more easily submit customer support tickets,  an dadded “Employees” and related sub-categories to the top-level navigation so both existing and prospective employees could easily find answers to their questions or submit a customer support ticket through an appropriate channel.</p>
