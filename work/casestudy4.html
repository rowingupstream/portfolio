                        <p>I collaborated with the Product Marketing team to build a quiz experience that educates prospects and partners about the hidden costs of different on-demand pay experiences. DailyPay enables major employers to provide on-demand pay to their employees, which gives them up to 100% access to their earned income and helps them improve their financial well-being.</p>

                        <h4>Plan For Future Needs</h4>
                        <p>Stakeholder interviews revealed new product categories, new audiences, and differing points of view that needed to be included. It was clear that the navigation did not accurately represent the new positioning of the company. These conversations provided a clearer picture of the company roadmap. We were able to design and build with this in mind, which allowed us to make more informed decisions and create a better navigation menu.</p>

                        <h4>Pushing Forward</h4>
                        <p>We were under a tight deadline and the company rebrand was behind schedule just days before a high-profile launch. This created challenges and required us to manage expectations internally. Due to deadline constraints, the agency responsible for the build was unable to launch the navigation as designed. Post launch we worked to get closer to the original design. Then we shifted work back in-house where we continued to make improvements.</p>
