                        <p>I collaborated with the Demand Generation team to design a new demo page in an effort to create a more compelling and streamlined experience for B2B prospects. To create more interest and engagement we added partner testimonial videos, prominent partner logos for social proof, and leadership videos. I also created multiple designs to test an an effort to determine ways we might be able to increase conversion. During this process, I uncovered a major pain point for the Demand Generation and Customer support teams that I worked to resolve.</p>

                    <h3>Finding the Root Causes of the Problem</h3>
                    <p>When I evaluated the old demo page I questioned why there was a radio button group with an option to request a demo and an option for customer support requests. DailyPay’s model is to B2B and B2C because they sign up a company, who then offers the product as a benefit to their employees. However, the demo was clearly not intended to be a customer support channel. My intuition was that the radio buttons could drive down conversion and was an unnecessary choice for B2B prospects.</p>
                    <p>First, it should be noted that DailyPay provides employees early access to earned wages. Therefore, any problem with a transaction is of the utmost importance and can impact an employee’s ability to pay for unexpected bills, family needs, or emergencies. After evaluating the website for additional customer support channels and speaking with a Customer Support Lead I began to form a clearer picture of why customers may be using the demo page for customer support inquiries.</p>
                    <p>Below are the key reasons that I discovered were causing the issues.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Customer Support Contact Form - Upon form submission there was no indiation of standard or current response times from customer support.</li>
                        <li>Customer Support Ticket Backlog - Due to rapid growth product growth the customer support team was ramping up hiring. As a result the customer support backlog and response times also increased.</li>
                        <li>Employees Not in Main Navigation - There was an employee landing page, but the website was primarily focused on B2B prospects. There was no top-level navigation item directing employees to learn more or toward desired support channels.</li>
                        <li>Quick Fixes on Demo Page - I learned that the addition of radio buttons to the demo page was a quick fix by the Demand Generation team to prevent customer support requests from getting mixed up with B2B demo requests. Otherwise, team members wasted time contacting employees and had to manually refer them to customer support. I believed that this quick fix was actually encouraging customer behavior that we wanted to put an end to.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>My time spent evaluating the site and speaking with internal stakeholders enabled us to improve the demo page and better serve both our B2B and B2C customers. We streamlined the demo form by removing the radio buttons, added a Login link for employees below the demo request form so that they could more easily submit customer support tickets,  an dadded “Employees” and related sub-categories to the top-level navigation so both existing and prospective employees could easily find answers to their questions or submit a customer support ticket through an appropriate channel.</p>
