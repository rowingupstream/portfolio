                <p>I strategically rebuilt DailyPay’s demo page to highlight the company’s value propositions and make it easier for a prospect to sign up for a demo. DailyPay enables major employers to provide on-demand pay to their employees, which gives them access to their earned income and helps them improve their financial health. As a result, employers receive more applicants and experience a reduction in turnover and increased employee engagement.</p>

        <h3>Learning From Internal Teams</h3>
        <div class="bottom">
            <div class="learnings">
                <h4>Gaining Context</h4>
                <p>The project provided valuable context into roles and challenges of our Lead Generation and Customer Support teams, as well as the customer experience for our users. The insights gained by working with these teams enabled me to make informed decisions while rebuilding the demo page. They also supported my efforts to build a new Employee page on our site and a desktop and mobile navigation to improve our customer experience for our users.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="learnings">
                <h4>New Insights</h4>
                <p>I streamlined the page and reduced the number form fields to improve the user experience and the site’s conversion rate. I also learned the old page design was influenced by partner employees incorrectly using the form for customer support. Understanding this pain point was helpful in guiding further research to better understand the problem and how we may create better design decisions to support both prospects and partner employees.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="learnings">
                <h4>Further Exploration</h4>
                <p>Upon further research I hypothesized that increased customer support response times, customer support confirmation emails that did not include an expected response time, and a navigation menu that lacked an obvious path for employees were likely key reasons that employees were misusing the demo page. In the end, I was able to improve the product demo page and develop solutions to problems that were uncovered during this project.</p>
