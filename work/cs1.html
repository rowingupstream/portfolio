                <h3>DailyPay is a fintech company that provides earned income software and a suite of payroll products that enable large employers to provide hourly workers with on-demand pay.</h3>
                <p>As a result, a team of in-house employees and an external web agency were tasked with rolling out the new brand and making needed improvements to the website including the launch of a new navigation. This opportunity allowed us to improve the user experience and elevate the brand, but launching the project would be more challenging than initially anticipated.</p>

            <div class="learnings">
                <h4>Align Align Align</h4>
                <p>Engaging internal Marketing, Product, and Executive leadership made it clear that there was work to be done to gather each team’s perspective and get alignment on how the navigation could best reflect user needs and the future of the company.  Knowing what I do now, I would have started this process earlier. It took considerable time and effort to gain alignment across internal leadership, while pushing up against a hard deadline.</p>

            <div class="learnings">
                <h4>Plan For Future Needs</h4>
                <p>Stakeholder interviews revealed new product categories, new audiences, and differing points of view that needed to be included. It was clear that the navigation did not accurately represent the new positioning of the company. These conversations provided a clearer picture of the company roadmap. We were able to design and build with this in mind, which allowed us to make more informed decisions and create a better navigation menu.</p>

                <h4>Pushing Forward</h4>
                <p>We were under a tight deadline and the company rebrand was behind schedule just days before a high-profile launch. This created challenges and required us to manage expectations internally. Due to deadline constraints, the agency responsible for the build was unable to launch the navigation as designed. Post launch we worked to get closer to the original design. Then we shifted work back in-house where we continued to make improvements.</p>
