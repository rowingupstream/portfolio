                    <div class="about-content">
                        <h3>I’m a Senior Product Designer currently working at Solo Brands, a fast-growing DTC platform that operates premium outdoor lifestyle brands including Solo Stove, Chubbies, Oru Kayak, and ISLE Paddle Boards.
                        </h3>
                        <p>Prior to joining Solo Brands, I was a product designer at DailyPay, a NYC-based fintech company that is a leader in the on-demand pay industry by enabling companies to provide employees with instant access to their earned wages.</p>
                        <p>My design career started out in graphic design, at a global integrated marketing agency where I had the opportunity to work with clients such as REI Co-op, CVS Health, and Lenovo Computers.</p>
                        <p>Like many designers, I took a non-linear path to a design career. Before I changed careers, I worked in the public and non-profit sectors, where I collaborated with business, government and community stakeholders on economic and community development programs and policies.</p>
                        <p>I’m a man of many interests, including design, tech, finance, history, art and sports. In my free time you'll find me running, reading, enjoying the outdoors, and learning to code.</p>
