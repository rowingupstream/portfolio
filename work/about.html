                        <h3>I’m a Senior Product Designer currently working at Solo Brands, a fast-growing DTC platform operating premium outdoor lifestyle brands including Solo Stove, Chubbies, Oru Kayak, and ISLE Paddle Boards.
                        </h3>
                        <p>Prior to joining Solo Brands, I was a product designer at DailyPay, a NYC-based fintech company that is a leader in the on-demand pay industry by enabling companies to provide employees with instant access to their earned wages.</p>
                        <p>My design career begin in graphic design, at an integrated marketing agency where I worked with a diverse roster of clients such as REI Co-op, CVS Health, and Lenovo Computers.</p>
                        <p>Like many designers, I took a non-linear path to a design career. Before I changed careers, I worked in the public and non-profit sectors, where I collaborated with business, government and community stakeholders on economic and community development programs and policies.</p>
                        <p>I’m a man of many interests, including design, tech, sports, history, art, and the outdoors. In my free time you'll find me running, reading, watching sports, and learning to code.</p>
